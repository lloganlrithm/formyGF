        <p>“Congratulations on passing the exam! You’re really amazing. I’m so proud of you. I made this website because I wanted to surprise you and give it as a gift to celebrate your success. It might not be very beautiful, but I put a lot of effort into it. I hope you like it. I wish you a very happy university life, with lots of good friends, tons of luck, and as many A++ grades as you can get. I hope you’re always surrounded by lovely people. I’ll always be here to support you. <br>Love you baby!”</p>
